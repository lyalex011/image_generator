### Used technologies

QuickPic Generator was conceived and developed as a profound learning experience to improve skills in JavaScript, ReactJS and Tailwind CSS.
From setting up the initial project structure to implementing interactive components, every step became a valuable learning milestone that helped to dive deep into ReactJS, understanding concepts like component composition, state management, and working with data from API fetching. Additionally, I explored the flexibility and utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS, allowing us to streamline the styling process and create responsive user interfaces with ease.
